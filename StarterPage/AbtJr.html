<h1> Bowser Jr. Bio Page!</h1>

<h2>I know you cant wait to hear more about the little guy</h2>

<h4>So, here's the deal:</h4>

<p>Bowser Jr is the son of Bowser (Crazy right?) </p>
<p>He rocks, and has all of the cool things about Bowser (fire breath, shell, rich, anger) but he can also kinda talk sometimes, has a badass bandana and he's much cuter objectively. </p>

<p>He first appeared in Super Mario Sunshine (2002) where he dressed up as Shadow Mario and covered the Isle of Delfino in graffiti with a magic paintbrush and some tools of his own design. Ever since then he has been getting money, inventing new gadgets, appearing in Mario Kart, being a nuisance to those pesky Mario Bros and even appearing in two Super Smash Brothers games!</p>

<p>He's not the biggest and he's not the toughest. But he's crafty and despite a love of mischief and a desire to make his papa proud he has a good heart. </p>

<p>For some reason, he is generally awful in most games that he appears in. He has the worst statistics in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and according to top players he is in the bottom 12 of character strength in both iterations of Smash Brothers he appears in. Only 5 characters are worse than him in both Smash games where Jr is playable</p>

<p>But that doesn't change anything about the fact that he's neat, and that he rocks, and he even has some positive showings in games like Mario Strikers Charged and Mario Kart: Double Dash where he is a winning pick for even the best of players.</p>
